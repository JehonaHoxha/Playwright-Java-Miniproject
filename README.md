# Playwright + Java â€“ Miniproject
This project is designed to automate testing of a website using Playwright in Java.

## Overview

This automation project aims to test the functionality of a website called "nopCommerce". It uses the Playwright library in Java to interact with the website's elements and perform various testing scenarios.

## Features

- **Automated Testing**: The project includes automated test cases that cover various functionalities of the website, such as user registration, login, product browsing, and shopping cart management.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: The project follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which helps in organizing and maintaining the test code by separating the page elements and their interactions into individual classes.

- **Screenshot Capture on Failure**: The project is configured to capture screenshots automatically whenever a test case fails. This helps in identifying the cause of test failures and debugging issues more effectively.
